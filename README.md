### Mathematical background

- In our game, "p1" denotes Player 1 and "p2" denotes Player 2.
- In our game, p1 is playing UP or DOWN and p2 is playing LEFT or RIGHT.
- The payoff $x,y$ is such that p1 recieves $x$ utility and p2 receives $y$ utility.
- The strategy $p\text{UP} + (1-p)\text{DOWN}$ is a strategy that involves playing UP with probabilty $p$ and DOWN with probability $1-p$.
 
Consider the following 2x2 game:

|       | LEFT    | RIGHT   |
| :---: | :---:   | :---:   |
| UP    | $x1,y1$ | $x2,y4$ |
| DOWN  | $x3,y3$ | $x4,y4$ |

To find Nash Equilibria we will assume p1 plays $p\text{UP} + (1-p)\text{DOWN}$ and p2 plays $q\text{LEFT} + (1-q)\text{RIGHT}$.

Indifference occurs for p1 if the payoff from UP is equal the payoff from DOWN, that is, if $(x1)q + (x2)(1-q) = (x3)q + (x4)(1-q).$\
$(x1)q + (x2)(1-q) = (x3)q + (x4)(1-q) \iff$ \
$(x1)q + (x2) - (x2)q = (x3)q + (x4) - (x4)q \iff$ \
$(x1)q - (x2)q - (x3)q + (x4)q = (x4) - (x2) \iff$ \
$q(x1 - x2 - x3 + x4) = (x4 - x2) \iff$ \
$q = (x4 - x2) / (x1 - x2 - x3 + x4).$

Indifference occurs for p2 if the payoff from LEFT is equal the payoff from RIGHT, that is, if $(y1)p + (y3)(1-p) = (y2)p + (y4)(1-p).$\
$(y1)p + (y3)(1-p) = (y2)p + (y4)(1-p) \iff$ \
$(y1)p + (y3) - (y3)p = (y2)p + (y4) - (y4)p \iff$ \
$(y1)p - (y3)p - (y2)p + (y4)p = (y4) - (y3) \iff$ \
$p(y1 - y3 - y2 + y4) = (y4 - y3) \iff$ \
$p = (y4 - y3)  / (y1 - y3 - y2 + y4).$

In our game, p1 is indifferent between UP and DOWN for any $q$ if both $x1 = x3$ and $y2 = y4$.\
In our game, p2 is indifferent between LEFT and RIGHT for any $p$ if both $y1 = y2$ and $y3 = y4$.\
Hence there are infinitely many NE if both $x1 = x3$ and $y2 = y4$, or both $y1 = y2$ and $y3 = y4$. This follows from the fact that there exists at least one NE for our game, since from this one NE we can generate infinitely many more NE via mixing.

If the $p$ and $q$ that we generated by solving for indifference satisfy $p, q \in [0,1]$, then $(p\text{UP} + (1-p)\text{DOWN}, q\text{LEFT} + (1-q)\text{RIGHT})$ is a Nash Equilibrium. This is because the players would be mutually indifferent.

We know that p1 plays UP if $q(x1 - x2 - x3 + x4) > (x4 - x2)$ and p1 plays DOWN if $q(x1 - x2 - x3 + x4) < (x4 - x2)$. Also, p2 plays LEFT if $p(y1 - y3 - y2 + y4) > (y4 - y3)$ and p2 plays RIGHT if $p(y1 - y3 - y2 + y4) < (y4 - y3)$. Therefore, the following holds.\
$(1\text{UP} + 0\text{DOWN}, 1\text{LEFT} + 0\text{RIGHT})$ is a NE if $x1 - x2 - x3 + x4 > x4 - x2$ and $y1 - y3 - y2 + y4 > y4 - y3$.\
$(1\text{UP} + 0\text{DOWN}, 0\text{LEFT} + 1\text{RIGHT})$ is a NE if $0 > x4 - x2$ and $y1 - y3 - y2 + y4 < y4 - y3$.\
$(0\text{UP} + 1\text{DOWN}, 1\text{LEFT} + 0\text{RIGHT})$ is a NE if $x1 - x2 - x3 + x4 < x4 - x2$ and $0 > y4 - y3$.\
$(0\text{UP} + 1\text{DOWN}, 0\text{LEFT} + 1\text{RIGHT})$ is a NE if $0 < x4 - x2$ and $0 < y4 - y3$.
